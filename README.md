# Python

compare_sorts -> The function compares the average times of different sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort. It creates 100 arrays containing 50 integers in the interval [-2000, 2000], which are then sorted by each algorithm, and the sort times are saved in separate files. 
    Finally, the average of the sorting times by each algorithm is calculated and a graph is drawn showing a comparison of the sorting times of successive arrays by the three algorithms.

connect_four -> The popular connect four game. The program in the console version 
    Allows multiple games against a computer opponent (checking and counting wins according to the rules of the game). The computer blocks the player's wins and pursues the exiled player.
    
grography_test -> For a given number of students (specified by the user), the program generates files representing tests (random order of questions, random 3 wrong answers and one right answer) - all based on the file capitals.txt. 
     It also generates files with correct answers for a given test.

heads_or_tails -> This is a popular game that involves tossing a coin (1, 2, 5 zl). In each round, a toss of three coins is made. If heads fall on a coin, the value of the coin is added to the balance. The game ends when the balance is equal to or greater than 20 zl. 
    A balance equal to exactly 20 zl means a win, and a larger balance means a loss.

plane -> drawing outlines from a picture and joining two pictures together
